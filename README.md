# rock-paper-scissors

My first project in JavaScript!

In this project i learnt how stupid the computer is and how useful is Chrome DevTools..

i almost banged my head when function (playRound) returns undefined, i tried solving that problem for almost two days and thanks to Chrome DevTools and my good sight jk, i found the solution.

the problem was a capital first letter!!

i read a couple of times that javaScript is case-sensitive but experiencing it myself is something else..

i'll for sure retrun to this project and re-do it when i level up :)
